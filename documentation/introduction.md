# Introduction

**environments** is a framework for adding development environments to code repositories. It provides defaults for generic projects, as well as for specific languages and frameworks, and allows for these environments to be activated and deactivated independently of one another. It also allows local, project-specific environments to be created alongside the officially provided ones.
