# Introduction

**environments** is a framework for adding development environments—including
programming language interpreters and compilers, linters, formatters, etc.—to
code repositories. It provides defaults for generic projects, as well as for
specific languages and frameworks, and allows for these environments to be
activated and deactivated independently of one another. It also allows local,
project-specific environments to be created alongside the officially provided
ones.

Available environments:
